# Test Approach

## Objective

To perform functional testing of the Buggy Cars Rating application and determine if any critical scenarios are broken. 

Functional areas:

- Log-in
- Registration
- Profile 
- Voting
- Popular make 
- Popular model 
- Overall rating  

As no written requirements are available for the application, exploratory testing will be performed with a focus on important work flows of the application.

## Scope 

- Functional testing
- Browser - Google Chrome
- Automate critical scenarios

## Automation 

Scenarios to automate will be considered based on the following:

- Functionality that is used repetitively
- Functionality that is critical to the working of the application
- Functionality that is stable and not subject to constant change
- Functionality that is time consuming to test manually, and is tested frequently as part of Smoke and Regression testing

Critical scenarios selected for automation:

1. As a valid user I can log-in and vote for a desired car model
2. As a valid user I can change my password
3. As a new user I can register 
4. As a valid user I can update details on the profile page
5. Validating fields in the registration page
